Employee Salary Prediction
Introduction
This project aims to predict employee salaries based on a variety of factors, including demographics, job roles, education, and performance metrics. By combining machine learning techniques in Python and data visualizations in Power BI, the project provides actionable insights to optimize compensation strategies and improve HR decision-making.

Features
Machine Learning Models:

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (TF-IDF, Count Vectorization)
Data Visualizations:

Power BI dashboard featuring insights such as workforce distribution, department-level salary trends, and demographic breakdowns.
Feature Engineering:

Interaction terms, polynomial features, and log transformations to capture non-linear relationships and improve model accuracy.
Clustering Analysis:

K-Means clustering to identify patterns in employee data, such as salary groups and performance clusters.
Project Highlights
Achieved 98% accuracy in salary prediction using Linear Regression with advanced feature engineering.
Developed a Power BI dashboard for interactive insights into employee demographics, experience, and salary trends.
Applied clustering to segment employees into salary ranges and performance groups.
Addressed data integrity issues through deduplication and label standardization, ensuring high-quality analysis.
Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 10,000 rows with the following key attributes:

Demographics: Age, Gender, City, Country, Marital Status.
Job Information: Department, Position, Experience, Performance Score.
Compensation: Salary (Target variable for prediction).
Education: Education Level (High School, Bachelor's, PhD).
